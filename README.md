This is a dutifully typed in copy of a [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly) program written in the summer of 1975 by myself and a school mate. It is written in [Macro-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACRO-10) and designed to run on a [PDP-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10) if you happen to have one handy.

It's intended to reincarnate this on a [PiDP-10](https://hackaday.io/project/170111-pidp-10) as soon as the kit becomes publically available.

**This project is very likely absolutely no use to anyone at all in any way shape or form.**

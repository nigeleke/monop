This is a nostalgic and dutifully typed in copy of a [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly)-like program written in the summer of 1975 by myself and a school friend. It is written in [Macro-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACRO-10) and designed to run on a [PDP-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10) if you happen to have one handy.

It's safe to say my friend and I were Monopoly fanatics, playing a dual board, figure of eight version of Monopoly every Saturday when we returned from our geek-out time at [Hatfield Polytechnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hertfordshire) (as it was then). We were privileged to have ample opportunity to use time on their DecSystem-10.

It's intended to reincarnate this on a [PiDP-10](https://hackaday.io/project/170111-pidp-10) as soon as the kit becomes publically available.

**This project is very likely absolutely no use to anyone at all in any way shape or form.**
